# MDB Half Page Image Carousel Template in ASP.NET MVC

Integrating MDBootstrap in ASP.NET MVC

Here you will find a working project to take as starting point.

Note that it includes a conditional attribute in "<header>" in order not to show the full height when the Carousel is not rendered (indicated by ViewBag.RenderCarousel).

Thanks to the MDBootstrap Team.
